            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Message from Takako</h1><p>My philosophy for therapy is that we all need to find “harmony/balance” in our lives to feel happy. As a cellist in a community orchestra, I came to realize there is similarity between music and life.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45789c7c-98f1-43d2-9715-55cc64c52f78.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Spiral Stairs</h1><p>Spiral Stairs - this stair case reminds me of a journey one might embark on.  I feel slightly uncomfortable when I take my first step. I cannot see what's coming next or who is around this sharp corner.  It is fairly dark with just a little bit of sunshine from the tiny window.  Again, I have to trust myself and feel safe even though I am not allowed to see exactly what's coming next.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df5a897e-0ea5-4ddf-a42c-f28a346ebda0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Life like Forest</h1><p>The forest reminds me of life.  It does not allow to one to see what's coming ahead, but we have to keep moving forward to the destination.  We have to trust ourselves in given situation even though we cannot see the entire picture sometimes.  Flip side is....life is fun because we don't know the outcome.  It gives us challenge and adventures...that's how we find truth in life.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/250b8ab2-9fe0-4aec-b25f-567fbdb3c06c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Joy of the Outdoors]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Joy of the Outdoors</h1><p>Today I had the opportunity to reflect on a wonderful trip recently to a farm up in Fresno. I was amazed by the simple and relaxed pace of the cows in the pasture on the ranch. There they were, with everything they needed, food, water, shade and friendship and they seemed very content. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8f4c299c-f186-4e1c-91fc-95509e7b1028.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Family Counseling]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Family Counseling</h1><p>Have you experienced feelings of thoughts like“Why did I choose him as my partner?” “I wish I had different mother. She doesn’t understand me!” “I don’t know what to do with my son…he is a great kid at home but he always gets in trouble at school.”Sometime we feel more overwhelmed and feel helpless because we have less control over other people and its their situations.Each family has different values and expectations which shape us when we are growing up. Those inherent differences confront us when we form a new family. Sometimes, it becomes more challenging because of different cultural principles and or spiritual values. Family therapy can provide an open and safe environment to work together through acknowledging differences and learning to accepting one another.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f264f8c4-a5b4-4c12-857a-0e8f1c80a3cd.png"></article>]]></description>
