            <title><![CDATA[Family Counseling]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Family Counseling</h1><p>Have you experienced feelings of thoughts like“Why did I choose him as my partner?” “I wish I had different mother. She doesn’t understand me!” “I don’t know what to do with my son…he is a great kid at home but he always gets in trouble at school.”Sometime we feel more overwhelmed and feel helpless because we have less control over other people and its their situations.Each family has different values and expectations which shape us when we are growing up. Those inherent differences confront us when we form a new family. Sometimes, it becomes more challenging because of different cultural principles and or spiritual values. Family therapy can provide an open and safe environment to work together through acknowledging differences and learning to accepting one another.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f264f8c4-a5b4-4c12-857a-0e8f1c80a3cd.png"></article>]]></description>
