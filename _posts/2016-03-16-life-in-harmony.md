**Offering clinical therapeutic services for the San Francisco community, specializing in individual, couples and group counseling with a focus on loss and grief.**

Life must be in harmony to achieve happiness. 

The expression "Life in Harmony" refers to the need we all have to maintain balance in relation to our selves, in our relationships with others and within our life circumstance and surroundings.

Many life lessons come to all of us equally and often unexpectedly, though some are more difficult than others. We all experience life's events such as relocation, change in a relationship, or illness which can create  "unbalance." Life by nature is always changing and becoming at times unsettled-life circumstances can cause us to lose our equilibrium. It is possible to assist clients in regaining balance in the ebb and flow of life experiences.

As many find themselves in a place of dissonance, through loss or difficulty, there is a way to find that needed balance. Clients typically seek therapeutic expertise for support related to many personal issues such as divorce, coping with chronic illness as well as relocation adjustment for individuals, couples and families.

We will help you to develop an individualized plan of care and to set goals. Each plan is uniquely designed for your specific needs.
