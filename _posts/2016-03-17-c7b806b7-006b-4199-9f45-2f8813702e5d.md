##### Work Stress and Heart Disease

##### _There has been much written on the effects of work stress and physical diseases, including heart disease. Backé et al did a review of multiple studies and found a common theme...there is a relationship between stress at work and increased amounts of heart disease:_

> __Stress may put our bodies out of balance and cause physical symptoms such as high blood pressure and high blood sugars that contribute to diabetes. Backé et al note, "there is clear need for primary interventions...lowering work stress by enhancing the ability of coping"__

Balance is a key component to living a happy and more successful life.  Work plays an important part of helping to find purpose, meaning, joy and satisfaction in life. Work also causes us to grow, which can be difficult at times.  This is where balance is key. We are able to center ourselves in many ways to find that balance between work and private life: through yoga, exercise, writing, drawing or other creative outlets around the work day.  Do you have a safe and sacred place for yourself to release pent up energy and reflect?  Encouraging regular sharing with friends, family, coworkers or a significant other also allow for ways to maintain balance. Each of these are ways to better cope with stress at work and help to prevent chronic and acute healthcare issues from arising.
