##### Work Stress Triggers Heart Disease and Diabetes

_An interesting article__dated January 25th2006 says__"A new study by researchers from UCL Epidemiology and Public Health has found that stress at work is an important factor in causing heart disease and diabetes (...) The study at University College London which was led by Dr Tarani Chandola, concludes:_

> __"One possible explanation is that prolonged exposure to work stress may affect the nervous system. Alternatively, chronic stress may reduce biological resilience and thus disturb the body's physiological balance."__

Having a balance is essential in our lives.  We often find joy, happiness, meaning, and passion through work and it is true that we learn and grow through work experience.   It is important to find the way to find balance between work and personal life.  Many people find "their centers" by doing exercise, yoga, playing music, writing journals or poetry before or after all day working.  Do you have safe place for yourself to release pent up energy?  Sharing thoughts and feelings with your family, friends, and co-workers in open & safe environment is also essential to maintain balance in our lives. As seen above, take your stress at work seriously, not listening to your body can and may lead to dire consequences.
