Ebb and Flow

Ocean waves are beautiful...calm and soothing.  They can be rough and harsh sometimes.  Sometimes we are afraid of waves because we are not sure whether if next waves are big and harsh.  Life has certainly ebb and flow like ocean waves.  We are forced to go under the waves...close our eyes.  Then, we hear our inner voice....trust yourself and trust within.
