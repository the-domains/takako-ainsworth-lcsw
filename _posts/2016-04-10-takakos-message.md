# Takako's Message

My philosophy for therapy is that we all need to find "harmony/balance" in our lives to feel happy. As a cellist, I came to realize there is similarity between music and life.

Music can demonstrate to us the importance of "harmonious balance." Life events which are distressing to us are like notes of music being played off-key or not in time with the music, that create "dissonance" in music. In both life and music we have to be self-aware and conscious of our own "notes" and also tune into others who are "playing" parts of the music in our lives to maintain balance.

If we focus too much on our notes (ourselves) and forget about others, then we lose balance and are out of harmony within our relationships. No one can live by themselves, yet conversely, we eventually feel dissatisfaction (dissonant) if we care too much for others and lose track of our own needs. When we create harmony within ourselves and our relationship with others then we are able to "play glorious music" (experience a rich life).

In life, when unexpected events happen we may lose our balance.  I believe we can live each day with satisfaction when we are able to move through those stressful events and regain balance in our lives.

_Life is in constant change. Even change we have wanted can challenge us to adjust. When the change is unwanted or we are not relating to it in a balanced way it is more difficult to move through and stay balanced. I assist clients to find happiness within, by regaining balance in the ebb and flow of life experiences._
