# "My speech is imperfect. Not because I want to shine with words, but out of the impossibility of finding those words, I speak in images. With nothing else I can express the words from the depths."

_**by C.G Jung (The Red Book)**_

Life is filled with images and experiences...filled with both highs and lows, ebbs and flows, like the image of the ocean when it touches the shore...fleeting and always changing. Change often brings challenge. With that change we may ask_"Why me?" "How did it happen to me?" _Such questions can cause anger or disappointment or loneliness...and one may feel that no one can understand what it's like to experience what we feel. 

Life changing events such as death, divorce, separation, illness, layoff, bankruptcy may come to us without warning. On the other hand new and exciting things like starting a new relationship, or embarking on a new job or having children are wonderful. They too can add stress in your life that may be difficult to manage alone. It is a natural process to struggle adjusting to new stress factors in your life. Individual counseling can help you to reevaluate your strength and regain hope in your life, bringing your life into balance and into harmony.
