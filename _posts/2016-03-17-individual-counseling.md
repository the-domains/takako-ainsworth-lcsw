"Though we can't always see it at the time, if we look upon events with some perspective, we see things always happen for our best interest. We are always guided in a way better than we know ourselves"

> _by Friedrich Schiller (German Poet) Inspirational Quotes"_

Life is filled with experiences...with highs and lows, ebbs and flows, like ocean waves. Sometimes we feel_"Why me?" "How did it happen to me?"_We feel sadness, anger, disappointment, loneliness...sometimes we feel like "no one understands me what I am going through...." Life events such as divorce, separation, illness, layoff, bankruptcy come to us without warning. Or, getting into a new relationship, a new job or having children could add stress in your life even though they are positive factors. It is natural to struggle with adjustment and coping with stress factors in your life. Individual counseling assists you to reevaluate your strength and regain hope in your life.
