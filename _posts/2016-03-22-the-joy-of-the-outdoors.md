# The Joy of the Outdoors

Today I had the opportunity to reflect on a wonderful trip recently to a farm up in Fresno. I was amazed by the simple and relaxed pace of the cows in the pasture on the ranch. There they were, with everything they needed, food, water, shade and friendship and they seemed very content. 

Reflecting back on our own life I was reminded of the aspects of simplicity in our life...and how easy it is to get caught in day to day life and miss this life lesson the cows already seem to know. I hope you enjoy this photo and it reminds you to take a moment to find the simplicity in your own life.
