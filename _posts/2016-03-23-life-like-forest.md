The forest reminds me of life.  It does not allow to one to see what's coming ahead, but we have to keep moving forward to the destination.  We have to trust ourselves in given situation even though we cannot see the entire picture sometimes.  Flip side is....life is fun because we don't know the outcome.  It gives us challenge and adventures...that's how we find truth in life.
