Spiral Stairs - this stair case reminds me of a journey one might embark on.  I feel slightly uncomfortable when I take my first step. I cannot see what's coming next or who is around this sharp corner.  It is fairly dark with just a little bit of sunshine from the tiny window.  Again, I have to trust myself and feel safe even though I am not allowed to see exactly what's coming next.
