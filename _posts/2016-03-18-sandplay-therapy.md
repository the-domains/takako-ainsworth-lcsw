One of the very interesting ways to explore therapy in a non-verbal setting is to utilize Sandplay Therapy. It offers a safe and protected space to delve into the unconscious mind and bring new awareness and psychological insight. It is often used to help bridge the unconscious and conscious mind for more in-depth healing and allows one's life to be lived in a more present and authentic way.
